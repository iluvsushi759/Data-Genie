Data_architect.py is a sample data Architecture challenge to yourself.  Describe your architecture and a model to OpenAI gpt 4-mini will be used.
This model will respond to by challenging things you might have not thought about or might have missed.
Deploy this to gitHub and connect your GitHub account to Streamlit IO.

Have fun!
